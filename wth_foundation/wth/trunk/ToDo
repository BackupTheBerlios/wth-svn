- include support for the PC weatherstation receiver. This
  needs rewrite of server software as there is no hardware
  ring buffer in this type of receiver.

- return values of the xmlrpc server should be general for
  other types of weatherstations as well. The currently 
  used byte strings are proprietary to the WS2000 
  weatherstations.

- incorporate logging to database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Berkeley DB)
  Jim has done Postgres already. What has left:
    postgres database, username _must_ be configurable
    code clean up for POSTGRES defines
    use a more general table format? 

- data exchange for other types of weatherstation software.


error messages
--------------
The error returning and echoing is implemented idiotically at 
this time as almost everything of interest goes to syslog.
Probably best would be:
  set error id ( int)
  set error string ( char *)
