Using wth with rrdtool

Timeseries weather data are stored in round robin archives with 
the use of rrdtool. Weather data which is stored in database is
periodically copied to the rrdtool database.

The rrdproc perl script provides functionality to 
- create the round robin archives 
- update the round robin archives
- graph images of the rrdtool data

Commandline options

include
--create this option is to create round robin archives as configured
         in the configuration file rrdproc.conf

--update to enter data to round robin archives. The archives must be 
         created first with the --create option. The data are read
         from the wth database. Location of the database is configured
         in the rrdproc.conf file. The update data are entered from 
         the first dataset available in the database which is older than 
         the last value of the round robin archive. Thus, if no data
         are in the round robin archive all data in the database are
         entered into the round robin archive.

--info   display some information of the round robin archives

--config <configfile> use <configfile>which holds the configuration data
         which are then read by rrdproc.

--graph  create and display images from round robin archives
