Hardware

The weatherstation is a modular wireless system which consists of 
	data receiver with integrated DCF77 time receiver and serial interface
	wind sensor
	rainfall sensor
	combined temperature humidity sensor

It is possible to install up to 16 temperature/humidity sensors, 1 wind sensor
and 1 rainfall sensor.
The receiver operates by wireless communication with air pressure, temperature, 
humidity, wind and rainfall sensors at a frequency of 433.92 MHz. The receiver 
stores the sensor data in a 32kB ring buffer. The sensors have approximately 
100m reach which can be extended by repeaters. They operate independently using 
a integrated solar module. The sensors are detected automagically by the receiver
at power on. 
The receiver is connected thru a standard RS232 serial line with the computing
equipment and is battery powered (4 AA batteries, haven't been replaced within 
one year of operation)


For the software development a WS7000-13 receiver by CONRAD and a WS2000 receiver
by ELV have been used. Wireless indoor sensor S 2000 I.

The weatherstation modules are available as a set or in parts thru mailorder 
electronic resellers like ELV(www.elv.de) or CONRAD(www.conrad.de).
