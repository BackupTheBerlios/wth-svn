wth is a free software solution to read weatherstation data
of the Conrad or ELV WS2000 PC interface, which stores
data of as many as 16 temperature and humidity sensors, 1 wind 
sensor and 1 rainfall sensor. A DCF77 receiver is built into 
the interface. The interface connects thru the serial port to
the computing equipment. The communication protocol has been 
published by the manufacturer and is fully implemented by the 
wth software.

The code is seperated in three parts:

(1) a library which offers a high level functions to connect to the 
    PC interface or over the network.

(2) the TCP server code which allows for a network connection
    for remote data retrieval. This includes telnet access.

(3) the wthc client code either reads the PC interface or connects
    to the wthd server to retrieve data.
