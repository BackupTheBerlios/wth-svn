General
-------

wth is a free software solution to read sensor data of 
- WS2000 weatherstations 
  -- Lacrosse Technology WS2010 or 
  -- WS2000 PC interface by Conrad (www.conrad.de) or ELV (www.elv.de) 
  -- PC weatherstation receiver made by ELV (ELV)
- 1-Wire weatherstations
- WMR 9x8 weatherstations
- Peetbros Ultimeter weatherstations
  -- datalogger mode
  -- packet mode
data is stored in sqlite database

Compiling
---------
Compiling wth uses GNU make
Simply type on FreeBSD
gmake

Linux uses GNU make by default
make

Installation
------------
make install


Configuration
-------------
edit /usr/local/etc/wth/wth.conf to match
your hardware setup


Running
-------
To start wthd type

sudo /usr/local/bin/wthd

wthd will set itself in background (run as daemon). Measurement data are 
logged to rrd and sqlite database. A TCP server is started listening at
port 2000, which provides telnet access.

Weatherstation configuration is done in wth.conf which must be in directory
/etc/wth
/usr/local/etc/wth


Telnet commands
---------------
Connecting
use telnet command to connect to wthd
telnet localhost 2000

available commands are

show data <weatherstation>
show status <weatherstation>
show config <weatherstation>
exec <weatherstation> <command>
restart
reload <weatherstation>

<weatherstation> in ws2000, pcwsr


Troubleshooting
---------------
Start wthd in debugging mode
sudo ./wthd -d


gcc-4.2 issue
-------------
Compiling wthc with gcc-4.2 will issue some warnings about incompatible pointers
Running wthc will cause a segmentation fault
Compile wthc using gcc-3.4, no errors at compile time, running smoothly


Units of meteorological observations
------------------------------------
Atmospheric pressure, p, [hPa]
Temperature, t, [deg C] or T [Kelvin]
Wind speed, metres per second [ m  s-1 ]
Wind direction, degrees clockwise from or on the scale 0-36, wehre 36 is the wind from the north and 09 is wind from east [deg]
Relative humidity, U, [%]
Precipitation (total amount), [mm  m-2] or [kg  m-2]
Precipitation intensity, R_i, [ mm  h-1 ] or [kg m-2 s-1]

Visibility, [m]
Irradiance [ W m-2] and Radiant exposure, [ J m-2]
Duration of sunshine, [h]
Cloud height [m]
Cloud amount [okta]
