wth is a free software solution to read weatherstation data
of the Lacrosse Technology WS2010 or Conrad resp. ELV WS2000 PC 
interface, which stores data of 16 temperature, humidity and 
pressure sensors, 1 wind sensor and 1 rainfall sensor. 

A DCF77 receiver is built into the interface. The interface connects 
thru the serial port to the computing equipment. The communication 
protocol has been published by the manufacturer and is fully 
implemented by the wth software.

Pressure is logged as received, i.e. as an absolute pressure value.

In order to change it to sealevel based value the following RRD CDEF 
will do
Thalreit HEIGHT = 456m
Munich   HEIGHT = 530m
456,8,/,press,+

Pressure plots range from 970 - 1040 (Seewetter), 945 - 1055 (Barograph
in Malberg, Meteorologie und Klimatologie)


Troubleshooting
---------------

FreeBSD
-------
Upgrading to FreeBSD 4.5 caused wthc to exit with timeout:

wthc -c0 -s -v

The following syslog messages occured:

Mar 19 21:50:58 pegasus wthc[40810]: experimental test release 0.4.2 - December 2001 
Mar 19 21:50:58 pegasus wthc[40810]: wcmd: called for command request: 0 
Mar 19 21:50:58 pegasus wthc[40810]: initserial: error fcntl: Inappropriate ioctl for device

Problem was that /dev hasn't been upgraded. Remake of device files
in /dev

sh MAKEDEV all

solved the issue.

wthc had been compiled with GNU build chain.
./generate_build
./configure 
gmake wthc


gcc-4.2 issue
-------------

Compiling wthc with gcc-4.2 will issue some warnings about incompatible pointers
Running wthc will cause a segmentation fault
Compile wthc using gcc-3.4, no errors at compile time, running smoothly
