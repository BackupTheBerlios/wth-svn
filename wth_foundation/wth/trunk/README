General
-------

wth is a free software solution to read weatherstation data
of the 
- Lacrosse Technology WS2010 or 
- WS2000 PC interface by Conrad (www.conrad.de) or ELV (www.elv.de) 
- PC weatherstation receiver made by ELV (ELV)

which store data of 16 temperature, humidity and 
pressure sensors, 1 wind sensor and 1 rainfall sensor. 

A DCF77 receiver is built into the interface. The interface connects 
thru the serial port to the computing equipment. The communication 
protocol has been published by the manufacturer and is fully 
implemented by the wth software.

Pressure is logged as received, i.e. as an absolute pressure value.

In order to change it to sealevel based value the following RRD CDEF 
will do
Thalreit HEIGHT = 456m
Munich   HEIGHT = 530m
456,8,/,press,+

Pressure plots range from 970 - 1040 (Seewetter), 945 - 1055 (Barograph
in Malberg, Meteorologie und Klimatologie)


Compiling
---------
Compiling wth uses GNU make
Simply type

gmake wthd


Running
-------
To start wthd type

sudo ./wthd

wthd will set itself in background (run as daemon). Measurement data are 
logged to rrd and sqlite database. A TCP server is started listening at
port 2000, which provides telnet access.

Weatherstation configuration is done in wth.conf which must be in directory
/etc/wth
/usr/local/etc/wth


Telnet commands
---------------
Connecting
use telnet command to connect to wthd
telnet localhost 2000

available commands are

show data <weatherstation>
show status <weatherstation>
show config <weatherstation>
exec <weatherstation> <command>
restart
reload <weatherstation>

<weatherstation> in ws2000, pcwsr


Troubleshooting
---------------
Start wthd in debugging mode
sudo ./wthd -d


gcc-4.2 issue
-------------
Compiling wthc with gcc-4.2 will issue some warnings about incompatible pointers
Running wthc will cause a segmentation fault
Compile wthc using gcc-3.4, no errors at compile time, running smoothly


Units of meteorological observations
------------------------------------
Atmospheric pressure, p, [hPa]
Temperature, t, [deg C] or T [Kelvin]
Wind speed, metres per second [ m  s-1 ]
Wind direction, degrees clockwise from or on the scale 0-36, wehre 36 is the wind from the north and 09 is wind from east [deg]
Relative humidity, U, [%]
Precipitation (total amount), [mm  m-2] or [kg  m-2]
Precipitation intensity, R_i, [ mm  h-1 ] or [kg m-2 s-1]

Visibility, [m]
Irradiance [ W m-2] and Radiant exposure, [ J m-2]
Duration of sunshine, [h]
Cloud height [m]
Cloud amount [okta]
