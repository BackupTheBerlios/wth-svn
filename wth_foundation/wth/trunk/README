General
-------

wth is a free software solution to read weatherstation data
of the Lacrosse Technology WS2010 or Conrad resp. ELV WS2000 PC 
interface, which stores data of 16 temperature, humidity and 
pressure sensors, 1 wind sensor and 1 rainfall sensor. 

A DCF77 receiver is built into the interface. The interface connects 
thru the serial port to the computing equipment. The communication 
protocol has been published by the manufacturer and is fully 
implemented by the wth software.

Pressure is logged as received, i.e. as an absolute pressure value.

In order to change it to sealevel based value the following RRD CDEF 
will do
Thalreit HEIGHT = 456m
Munich   HEIGHT = 530m
456,8,/,press,+

Pressure plots range from 970 - 1040 (Seewetter), 945 - 1055 (Barograph
in Malberg, Meteorologie und Klimatologie)


Compiling
---------
Compiling wth uses GNU make
Simply type

gmake wthd


Running
-------
To start wthd type

sudo ./wthd

wthd will set itself in background (run as daemon).
Configuration is done in wth.conf which must be in directory
/etc/wth
/usr/local/etc/wth


Troubleshooting
---------------
Start wthd in debugging mode
sudo ./wthd -d


gcc-4.2 issue
-------------
Compiling wthc with gcc-4.2 will issue some warnings about incompatible pointers
Running wthc will cause a segmentation fault
Compile wthc using gcc-3.4, no errors at compile time, running smoothly
