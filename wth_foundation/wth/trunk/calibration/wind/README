Hi Emmanuel: PDL is indeed a general purpose matrix manipulation language. It has similar features to IDL or MATLAB, but it has a more powerful scripting language and some nicer facilities for flowing data between dimensions in complex matrices.

I routinely pull numeric data from an SQL database to a PDL. The formula is something like this:

use DBI;
use PDL;
my $dbstr = "dbi:Pg:dbname=$dbname;host=$dbhost";
my $dbh   = DBI->connect($dbstr);
my $sql   = 'select yr, mon, day, value from db_table where yr=2007';
my $data  = pdl($dbh->selectall_arrayref($sql));

Now $data is a 4 x N PDL (which defaults to type 'double').

Regards,

  Doug
