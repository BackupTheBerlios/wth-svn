Wireless weatherstation in the UNIX environment


Overview
The wireless weatherstation comprises a weather measurement system to store 
data of as many as 16 temperature and humidity sensors, 1 wind sensor and 1 
rainfall sensor. Also a DCF77 time receiver is built into the weatherstation.
The system is connected to the computing equipment using a standard RS232 
serial link. Data are recorded within the weatherstation to a ringbuffer which 
can be read out by the computing equipment.
The wthc software has been written to communicate with the wireless 
weatherstation in the LINUX or FreeBSD environment. 




Hardware

The weatherstation is a modular wireless system which consists of 
	data receiver with integrated DCF77 time receiver and serial interface
	wind sensor
	rainfall sensor
	combined temperature humidity sensor

It is possible to install up to 16 temperature/humidity sensors, 1 wind sensor
and 1 rainfall sensor.
The receiver operates by wireless communication with air pressure, temperature, 
humidity, wind and rainfall sensors at a frequency of 433.92 MHz. The receiver 
stores the sensor data in a 32kB ring buffer. The sensors have approximately 
100m reach which can be extended by repeaters. They operate independently using 
a integrated solar module. The sensors are detected automagically by the receiver
at power on. 
The receiver is connected thru a standard RS232 serial line with the computing
equipment and is battery powered (4 AA batteries, haven't been replaced within 
one year of operation)


For the software development a WS7000-13 receiver by CONRAD and a WS2000 receiver
by ELV have been used. Wireless indoor sensor S 2000 I.

The weatherstation modules are available as a set or in parts thru mailorder 
electronic resellers like ELV(www.elv.de) or CONRAD(www.conrad.de).


Communication

Initialization
The serial line has to be set to 9600 baud, Even parity 8bit 2stop prior to 
communication. To begin communication the weatherstation has to initialized by 
setting RTS and DTR to low voltage, then rising DTR to high voltage. The 
weatherstation sends one "ETX" byte if it is initialized OK. 


Communication protocol
For all communication a protocol is necessary which consists of dataframes which 
are sent to or received from the weatherstation. This protocol has been published 
by the manufacturer and is repeated here shortly. The dataframe is a bytestring 
which starts with an STX byte and ends with an etx byte. The second byte contains the 
length of the bytestring. Then follows the data message (another bytestring) which 
has a variable length depending on the command or its response. The last but one 
byte is a checksum.


Command overview
The following commands are available as dictated by the manufacturer:
	Poll DCF time
	Read Dataset
	Skip to next dataset
	Activate 9 temperature/humidity sensors
	Activate 16 temperature/humidity sensors
	Read status
	Set measuring interval

	
Implementation
The wthc software is a full implementation of communication protocol of the wireless
weatherstation. The client program is able to communicate either with a locally attached
weatherstation or with a network service, which runs on another station with a locally
attached weatherstaion. The network service has been implemented as tcp server. The data 
exchange with the client software is done with the same protocol which is used 
over the serial line. The tcp server is able to communicate with the serially attached
weatherstation and then sends its data to the client software. Otherwise the tcpserver 
offers a telnet service with full functionality. The communication port with the client 
software is on port 3900, whereas telnet access is on port 3901.

WTHC(1)                                                   WTHC(1)


NAME
       wthc - control serial/network interface of weatherstation

SYNOPSIS
       wthc  [  -c  command   ] [ -s | -n ] [ -h hostname ]  [ -i
       intervall ] [ -p portnumber]

DESCRIPTION
       wthc controls the serial or network interface to a  weath-
       erstation  module.   It is possible to read data like tem-
       perature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, wind  direc-
       tion and rain fall. The DCF77 receiver can be read as well
       as current status information.  If the module is connected
       by  a  serial line, data is read directly from a 64kB ring
       buffer.  For network access a server process must  run  on
       the  system  where  the  weatherstation  module is locally
       attached.

   OPTIONS
       -c command
              specifies the command to be executed, where command
              can  take  values  as  described in section COMMAND
              PARAMETERS.

       -h hostname
              hostname or IP address to connect to remote server,
              in  case weatherstation is not locally connected to
              serial port.

       -i intervall
              intervall time of data sets collected  by  weather-
              station.  This option is only needed in conjunction
              with command 6.

       -p portnumber
              use portnumber to connect to remote server, default
              is 3963.

       -s     use local serial connection for readout

       -n     use  network  connection for readout, this needs an
              extra parameter h.





COMMAND PARAMETERS
       this section lists the command parameters available to set
       the values of command.

   command
       0      read  current  time  of  DCF  77  receiver.  If the
              receiver is not synchronized with DCF77 sender, the
              user is notified appropriately.

       1      read  topmost dataset off the ringbuffer, if avail-
              able.

WTHC(1)                                                   WTHC(1)


       2      pop topmost dataset off the ringbuffer and  advance
              to  read  next  available dataset. The next dataset
              can be read by issuing command 1.

       3      activate 9 temperature/humidity sensors.

       4      activate 16 temperature/humidity sensors.

       5      read status of weatherstation

       6      set intervall time, this requires an extra  parame-
              ter -i intervall time

       12     read  all datasets of the weatherstation interface.
              This is a recursive combination of command 1 and 2.

WTHD(1)                                                   WTHD(1)


NAME
       wthd - network service of weatherstation interface

SYNOPSIS
       wthd [ -d ] [ -p portnumber]

DESCRIPTION
       wthd  serves  incoming  network  requests  to read data of
       weatherstation interface, like temperature, humidity,  air
       pressure,  wind  speed, wind direction and rain fall.  The
       DCF77 receiver can be  read  as  well  as  current  status
       information.  To communicate with wthd a client program is
       needed, otherwise telnet access at full  functionality  is
       provided.

   OPTIONS
       -p portnumber
              use portnumber to listen on, default is 3900.

       -d     do not daemonize, stay in foreground

SEE ALSO
       wthc(1), telnet(1)

BUGS
       Prototype version. Network code probably unreliable.
