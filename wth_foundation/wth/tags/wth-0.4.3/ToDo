- include support for the PC weatherstation receiver. This
  needs rewrite of server software as there is no hardware
  ring buffer in this type of receiver.

- return values of the xmlrpc server should be general for
  other types of weatherstations as well. The currently 
  used byte strings are proprietary to the WS2000 
  weatherstations.

- incorporate logging to database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Berkeley DB)

- data exchange for other types of weatherstation software.


error messages
--------------
The error returning and echoing is implemented not very meaningful at 
this time as almost everything of interest goes to syslog.
