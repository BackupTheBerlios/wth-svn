wth is a free software solution to read weatherstation data
of the Conrad or ELV WS2000 PC interface, which stores
data of as many as 16 temperature and humidity sensors, 1 wind 
sensor and 1 rainfall sensor. A DCF77 receiver is built into 
the interface. The interface connects thru the serial port to
the computing equipment. The communication protocol has been 
published by the manufacturer and is fully implemented by the 
wth software.

The code is seperated in three parts:

(1) a library which offers a high level functions to connect to the 
    PC interface or over the network.

(2) the TCP server code which allows for a network connection
    for remote data retrieval. This includes telnet access.

(3) the wthc client code either reads the PC interface or connects
    to the wthd server to retrieve data.

As an asset, xmlrpc support has been added. The xmlrpc server 
wthxmld uses Eric Kidd's xmlrpc-c. The wthxc client code allows
to retrieve the weatherstation data. For demonstration purposes
a simple perl client - wth-xmlrpc - has been added as well.
RPC methods have been implemented to represent the protocol of
the WS2000 weatherstations. The return values are base64 encoded 
by the wthxmld server.

The wthxmld server needs a configuration file which is provided
in subdirectoy abyss/conf as file abyss.conf .

The wth-xmlrpc perl client uses  the perl module Frontier::Client
which must be installed for proper function.


Troubleshooting
---------------

FreeBSD
-------
Upgrading to FreeBSD 4.5 caused wthc to exit with timeout:

wthc -c0 -s -v

The following syslog messages occured:

Mar 19 21:50:58 pegasus wthc[40810]: experimental test release 0.4.2 - December 2001 
Mar 19 21:50:58 pegasus wthc[40810]: wcmd: called for command request: 0 
Mar 19 21:50:58 pegasus wthc[40810]: initserial: error fcntl: Inappropriate ioctl for device

Problem was that /dev hasn't been upgraded. Remake of device files
in /dev

sh MAKEDEV all

solved the issue.

wthc had been compiled with GNU build chain.
./generate_build
./configure 
gmake wthc
