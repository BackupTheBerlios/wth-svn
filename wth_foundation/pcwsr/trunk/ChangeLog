Version 0.1.3.
  Bug fixed: negative temperatures, IO redirection

Version 0.1.2.
  Handling all types of sensors (untested!)
  timestamp compiles w/o error
  optional raw dumping of serial data, seperated from debug output

Version 0.1.1
  Problem w/ insufficient access rights to serial line fixed
  display nicer now


Version 0.1
  first working solution
  only two sensors T/H resp T/H/P are displayed correctly
  contents of all sensors can be dumped by setting debug to 1 in the source
