Description
-----------
pcwsr is Free Software(http://www.gnu.org) to read the PC weathersensor 
receiver sold by ELV (http://www.elv.de, ELV Part No. 68-390-61). Different
types of weather sensors like temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind, rain
or brightness transmit measured values wireless (at 433MHz). The receiver is 
connected thru the serial port. The communication with the computing equipment
is unidirectional, i.e. the receiver writes the sensor data to the serial port
once they are received from the wireless sensors.

The communication protocol has been published by ELV (ELV Journal 6/2000). It
has been reproduced elsewhere (http://wth.berlios.de/station-protocol.txt).

The communication software pcwsr opens the serial port, sets the serial
configuration right, then loops to receive data from the serial port.


Screenshots
-----------
A typical screenshot of pcwsr looks like this:

volker@ikarus pcwsr-0.1.2 > ./pcwsr /dev/ttyS0
pcwsr 0.1 - experimental test version
Wed Nov 21 2001 19:54:49 |     wind (version 11 at address 0x07) | Speed[km/s] 1.5 | Direction [°] 95 +/- 45.0
Wed Nov 21 2001 20:00:37 |   indoor (version 11 at address 0x07) | T[°C] 18.1 | H[% rel.hum] 44 | P[hPa] 974


using the raw option the byte strings are dumped as received:

volker@ikarus pcwsr-0.1.2 > ./pcwsr -r /dev/ttyS0

Serial communication
--------------------
A crucial point in the development of the code was to get the serial communication
parameters right. In the first place, serial line snooping has been used to test
the PC software which comes with the weathersensor receiver 
(http://wth.berlios.de/SerialSnooping.html). The following settings for the
serial port have been found useful:

speed 19200 baud; rows 0; columns 0; line = 0;
intr = ^C; quit = ^\; erase = ^?; kill = ^U; eof = ^D; eol = <undef>;
eol2 = <undef>; start = ^Q; stop = ^S; susp = ^Z; rprnt = ^R; werase = ^W;
lnext = ^V; flush = ^O; min = 1; time = 5;
parenb parodd cs8 hupcl cstopb cread clocal -crtscts
-ignbrk -brkint -ignpar -parmrk -inpck -istrip -inlcr -igncr icrnl ixon -ixoff
-iuclc -ixany -imaxbel
-opost -olcuc -ocrnl onlcr -onocr -onlret -ofill -ofdel nl0 cr0 tab0 bs0 vt0
ff0
-isig -icanon iexten -echo -echoe echok -echonl -noflsh -xcase -tostop -echoprt
echoctl echoke

The serial has to be configured to 19200 Baud, 2 stop bits and odd parity. Also
it has to be set to raw mode for input and output by turning off ICANON, ISIG, ECHO
ECHOE and OPOST.

The data can most simply be received by
cat </dev/ttyS0 >>/tmp/raus

Each read will return 8 characters in case everything has been configured right.


Types of sensors
----------------
The following sensors have been tested so far successfully:

S2000A  outdoor temperature and humidity sensor
S2000W  wind sensor for speed and direction detection
S2000R  rain sensor 
S2000I  indoor sensor for temperature and humidity
S2000ID indoor sensor for temperature, humidity and air pressure


Unknown stuff
-------------
If the serialline is snooped using the WS-EMpfaenger.exe binary
which comes with the receiver it is noted that the software sends two byte strings 
to the PC weathersensor receiver. The two strings are 9 bytes long

01 ff 00 00 00 00 00 80 04
01 ff 00 00 00 00 00 80 04

I don't know howto interpret this.
